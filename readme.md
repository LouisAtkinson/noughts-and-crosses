This project was partially an exercise in using factory functions, which are used to generate each player and their respective mark ('X' or 'O'), and to create the board object. I then created an array the board cells, and used a for of loop to add a click event listener to each to allow each player to place their mark on the board.

To begin, the 'Enter player names' button is selected and the names chosen. Each game will result in a win or a draw, printing the appropriate message, and then the game can be repeated, or new names chosen.

To make the game more aesthetically pleasing, I imported the Varela Round font from Google fonts, and used a photo from Pexels as the background, credited below.
